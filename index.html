<p> As you can see from this photo, the VARUN appears to blend in with it's "friends". It also appears to tilt towards the sunlight, possibly to photosynthesize to feed it's overly trimmed leaves </p>
<p> This leads me to conclude that the VARUN (aliases vardar, kunjupapa) is an alien life form that as sucessfully blended in with it's human peers for approximately 18 years. </p>
